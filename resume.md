**Developer,** 2006 - present

As lead, and occasionally only developer on 2Checkout's public facing content
and website team, I was responsible for:

- Front and back end architecture decisions and development implementation.

  to the site, from small updates for pages to large projects that added new,
  custom functionality to the site.
- Short and long term project management and planning.
